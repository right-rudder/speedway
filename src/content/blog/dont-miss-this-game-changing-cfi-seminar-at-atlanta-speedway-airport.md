# Don't Miss This Game-Changing CFI Seminar at Atlanta Speedway Airport

Hey flight instructors! Got your calendar handy? You'll want to block off **September 19th** for an event that could seriously impact how you teach and how your students perform on checkrides.

The Atlanta Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) is coming to our home base at **Speedway Flight Training** to share some eye-opening data about CFI performance across Georgia. This isn't your typical safety meeting – it's a deep dive into what separates the instructors whose students consistently pass from those who struggle.

---

## What's Really on the Line Here?

Here's something that might surprise you: the **FAA tracks every single instructor's student pass rate**, and when those numbers drop, there are real consequences. The national average pass rate sits right at **80%**, and falling below this benchmark triggers increased FAA attention.

Think about it – when your student fails a checkride, it's not just disappointing for them. It becomes part of **your permanent record** as an instructor. The NTSB has been pushing for automated systems that alert inspectors whenever a CFI's pass rate drops below standards. While this system isn't fully implemented yet, the writing is on the wall.

---

## What Happens When Your Numbers Drop?

When CFI pass rates consistently fall below the **80% threshold**, here's what typically follows:

- **Increased Surveillance:** FSDO inspectors will start showing up more often to observe your teaching methods and evaluate how you prepare students.
- **Performance Reviews:** You might be asked to demonstrate your instructional abilities and prove you're up to date on current training standards.
- **Remedial Training:** Depending on what they find, you could need additional training, mentoring, or even temporary restrictions on your teaching activities.
- **Certificate Action:** In severe cases, the FAA can suspend or revoke your flight instructor privileges entirely.

Nobody wants to go down that road, right?

## Why This Matters for Speedway Flight Training

At **[Speedway Flight Training](/)**, we've built our reputation on excellence. Our students trust us to prepare them properly for their **[Private Pilot License](/programs/private-pilot), [Instrument Rating](/programs/instrument-rating), [Commercial License](/programs/commercial-pilot), and [instructor certifications](/programs/certified-flight-instructor)**.

When our instructors maintain high pass rates, everyone wins:

- Students save money and avoid the frustration of repeated checkrides
- Our reputation in the community stays strong
- We maintain great relationships with local DPEs and FSDO inspectors
- New students choose us based on word-of-mouth recommendations

---

## The Real Numbers Might Surprise You

Recent data shows some interesting patterns. While we often assume private pilot checkrides have high pass rates, they actually come in at just **74.5% nationally**. CFI checkrides, on the other hand, have been improving significantly from their historical averages.

The aviation industry has faced increased scrutiny of instructor performance, especially following accidents where inadequate training was identified as a contributing factor. Events like our **September 19th seminar** help us stay ahead of these evolving expectations.

---

## Bonus: WINGS Credit Available

This seminar qualifies for **FAA WINGS Program credit**, so you're knocking out continuing education requirements while gaining valuable professional insights. The WINGS Program specifically targets documented accident causal factors through focused training – exactly the kind of proactive approach that keeps our industry safe.

---

## Come Prepared to Learn

Plan to attend with specific questions about your own teaching methods and student outcomes. Bring:

- A notepad for performance metrics and benchmarks
- Questions about challenging scenarios you've encountered
- An open mind for networking with fellow instructors
- Curiosity about FSDO resources for professional development

---

## The Bottom Line

The aviation training world is evolving, with higher standards and greater accountability for instructors every year. At **[Speedway Flight Training](/)**, we're committed to staying ahead of these changes rather than scrambling to catch up.

This seminar on **September 19th** offers **WINGS credit** and invaluable insights into maintaining the high standards our students deserve. Whether you're a seasoned CFI or newer to instruction, this data-driven presentation will give you tools to improve your teaching effectiveness.

Your professionalism and commitment to continuous learning is what makes **[Speedway Flight Training](/)** a leader in aviation education. Let's use this opportunity to strengthen our instruction quality and keep our student success rates where they belong – at the top.
