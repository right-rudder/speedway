## Steps to Earning Your PPL

### 1. **Meet the Basic Requirements**

- Be at least 17 years old
- Be able to read, speak, write, and understand English
- Hold at least a third-class medical certificate

### 2. **Ground School Training**

Before you take to the skies, you’ll complete ground school training that covers the principles of flight, navigation, weather, FAA regulations, and more. Speedway Flight Training offers both in-person and online options to fit your schedule. Ground school is crucial for building foundational knowledge that you will apply during your flight lessons. Our goal is to make complex aviation concepts clear and easy to understand, so you feel confident when stepping into the cockpit.

### 3. **Flight Training**

You are required to complete a minimum of 40 hours of flight time, including:

- **20 Hours of Dual Instruction:** Flying with a [Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)](https://www.speedwayft.com/programs/certified-flight-instructor), practicing maneuvers, takeoffs, landings, and emergency procedures. This is where you learn to handle the aircraft under various conditions, both standard and emergency, to build strong situational awareness and control.
- **10 Hours of Solo Flight:** Building confidence and mastery of key skills, including solo cross-country flights. These solo sessions are your chance to demonstrate proficiency and independence in flight.
- **Cross-Country Flight Training:** At least one solo flight over 150 nautical miles with landings at multiple airports. This segment prepares you for real-world navigation and airport operations, expanding your comfort zone and skills.

### 4. **Knowledge Test**

The FAA Knowledge Test is a written exam covering everything you've learned in ground school. Speedway Flight Training provides test preparation resources, including mock tests, study guides, and review sessions to ensure you're ready to ace the exam on your first try.

### 5. **Checkride Preparation**

The final step is preparing for your FAA Checkride, which includes an oral exam and a practical flying test. Your instructor will conduct mock checkrides to build your confidence and fine-tune your skills. This preparation is intensive and designed to not only meet but exceed FAA standards, ensuring you are confident and capable on the big day.
