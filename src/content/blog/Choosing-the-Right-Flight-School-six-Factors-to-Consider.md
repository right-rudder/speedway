## 1. FAA Certification

Make sure the flight school is certified by the FAA. This means they follow proper rules and safety standards.

Speedway Flight Training is a **Part 61** school and is actively pursuing **Part 141** certification. This gives students flexible training options while maintaining a professional standard.

## 2. Good Instructors

Your instructors should be experienced, approachable, and committed to student progress.

At Speedway, all instructors are **CFIs or CFIIs**, and several hold **Gold Seal Instructor** status — a recognition awarded for student success. Many of our team trained here themselves and understand how to guide students from first flight to final checkride.

## 3. Safe, Reliable Aircraft

You want to train in clean, well-maintained aircraft with modern avionics.

Our fleet includes **four IFR-certified Cessna 172s**, each equipped with **Garmin G5s**, **650Xi GPS**, and **GFC 500 autopilot** (in two aircraft). These are ideal for private pilot students, instrument training, and even commercial maneuvers.

## 4. Programs That Fit Your Needs

Whether you’re looking to fly recreationally or start a professional career, the school should offer a clear path.

We offer training for **Private Pilot, Instrument, Commercial, Multi-Engine, CFI, CFII**, and a full **Fast Track to the Flight Deck** program. Lessons are available daily from **6 AM to 11:30 PM** for maximum scheduling flexibility.

## 5. Cost Transparency and Payment Options

A trustworthy school will be upfront about pricing and support students with financing options.

At Speedway, we keep pricing competitive and transparent. Our **flight training cost calculator** helps you estimate your total investment. We're also building partnerships with providers like **Stratus Financial** to help make aviation more accessible.

## 6. A Supportive Community

Beyond technical instruction, a great school creates a culture of support and mentorship.

Speedway isn’t just a training center — it’s a tight-knit aviation community. We use the **FAA WINGS program**, follow the **Gleim syllabus**, and work closely with DPEs to keep students confident and prepared.
