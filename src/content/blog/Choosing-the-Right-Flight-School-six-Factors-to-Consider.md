Choosing the right flight school is a big decision when you're starting your aviation journey. Here are six important things to think about — and how **Speedway Flight Training** makes each one count.

## 1. **FAA Certification**

Make sure the flight school is certified by the FAA. This means they follow proper rules and safety standards.

Speedway Flight Training is a **Part 61** school with plans to become **Part 141**. This means students get flexible training that fits different schedules, while still learning the right way.

## 2. **Good Instructors**

Your instructors should be experienced and helpful. They guide you through lessons, help you build strong habits, and prepare you for checkrides.

At Speedway, our instructors are **CFIs and CFIIs** who truly care about each student. Many of them trained here and now teach others. Some even hold **Gold Seal Instructor** status, which is earned through student success.

## 3. **Safe, Reliable Aircraft**

A good flight school has well-maintained aircraft with updated equipment. This helps you train in real-world conditions.

Our fleet includes **four Cessna 172s**, all **IFR certified** and equipped with **Garmin 650XI**, **dual G5s**, and two planes with **GFC 500 autopilot**. These aircraft are clean, consistent, and perfect for both new and advanced students.

## 4. **Programs That Fit Your Needs**

You’ll want options for training — whether you're just starting or working toward a career. Scheduling should be flexible too.

Speedway offers training for **Private, Instrument, Commercial, CFI, CFII**, and more. We also offer a **Professional Pilot Program** called **Fast Track to the Flight Deck (FTFD)**. Lessons are scheduled from **6 AM to 11:30 PM**, so you can fly when it works best for you.

## 5. **Cost and Payment Options**

Flight training is a big investment. Look for schools that are open about pricing and offer ways to help you manage costs.

We’re committed to fair, **competitive pricing**. You can use our **price calculator**, and we’re working to bring on partners like **Stratus Financial** to help students fund their training.

## 6. **Extra Support and Community**

Great schools go beyond just flight lessons. They should offer career guidance, support with testing, and a strong sense of community.

At Speedway, we’re a close-knit team. Instructors, students, and staff all support each other. We participate actively in the **FAA WINGS program**, use the FAA-approved **Gleim brand syllabus** to ensure standardized, comprehensive course content, and have strong connections with DPEs to help students feel confident going into checkrides.

## Why Choose Speedway?

Speedway Flight Training started as a family project and grew into a full flight school based at **KHMP (Hampton, GA)**. We’re near the **Atlanta Motor Speedway**, with easy access to practice areas and nearby **Class B airspace** for advanced training.

With updated aircraft, friendly instructors, flexible schedules, and a welcoming feel, Speedway is the right choice whether you’re flying for fun or starting your career.
