Have you ever looked up at a plane soaring overhead and wondered what it would feel like to be the one at the controls? That moment when you're not just a passenger watching the world go by, but the pilot actually flying the aircraft? At Speedway Flight Training in Hampton, Georgia, we're here to turn that wonder into reality with our Discovery Flight experience.

## More Than Just a Ride—It's Your Flight

This isn't your typical sightseeing tour where you sit back and watch. From the moment you climb into the cockpit of our well-maintained Cessna aircraft, you become the pilot. With one of our experienced, certified instructors right beside you, you'll take the controls and experience the pure joy of flight firsthand.

No experience necessary—just bring your sense of adventure and maybe a camera to capture the incredible views you're about to see.

## Georgia From Above: A View Like No Other

Taking off from Atlanta Speedway Airport (KHMP), you'll immediately understand why pilots fall in love with flying. As your aircraft climbs into the Georgia sky, a stunning panorama unfolds beneath you:

**The Legendary Atlanta Motor Speedway** comes into view almost immediately—that famous NASCAR track looks absolutely incredible from above, with its distinctive curves and grandstands creating a striking pattern against the landscape.

**Lake Horton's Mirror-Like Surface** reflects the sky and surrounding forests in ways that will take your breath away. On crystal-clear days, you might even spot the Atlanta skyline twinkling in the distance.

**Rolling Countryside and Charming Small Towns** stretch out in every direction. You'll see neat farmland, winding rivers, dense woodlands, and those quintessentially Southern communities that make Georgia so special. Each season brings its own magic—vibrant greens in spring and summer, or the spectacular reds and golds of autumn.

## You're Really Flying—Here's What You'll Learn

The best part? You're not just along for the ride. Under your instructor's expert guidance, you'll learn to:

- Read and understand the key flight instruments
- Handle the aircraft during taxi, takeoff, and straight-and-level flight
- Execute smooth, controlled turns and basic maneuvers
- Experience real radio communications (when appropriate)

That moment when you realize you're actually flying an airplane—controlling its altitude, direction, and speed—is absolutely unforgettable. It's a feeling that stays with you long after you're back on the ground.

## The Perfect Starting Point

Whether you're curious about becoming a licensed pilot or simply want to check "fly a plane" off your bucket list, a Discovery Flight is the ideal first step. Many of our current students trace their aviation journey back to this very experience.

Here's something extra special: your Discovery Flight counts toward official flight training hours and gets logged in your pilot logbook. So if you do decide to pursue your license, you're already on your way!

## Why Choose Speedway Flight Training?

Flying out of a quiet, non-towered airport means a relaxed, low-pressure environment—perfect for first-time flyers. Yet we're close enough to controlled airspace that you'll get a taste of real-world aviation operations.

Our aircraft feature state-of-the-art Garmin avionics with digital displays and real-time traffic and weather systems. You'll be training on the same technology that professional pilots use every day.

Most importantly, our instructors genuinely love what they do. They remember the excitement of their own first flights and are passionate about sharing that joy with you. Your safety and comfort are their top priorities, but so is making sure you have the time of your life.

## The Perfect Gift (Yes, Even for Yourself!)
