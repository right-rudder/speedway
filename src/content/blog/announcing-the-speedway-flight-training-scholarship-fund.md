At Speedway Flight Training, we believe the dream of flight should be within reach for anyone willing to work for it. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re proud to introduce the **Speedway Flight Training Scholarship Fund** â€” a full-ride opportunity for high school juniors and seniors to earn their **Private Pilot Certificate** at no cost. This is more than a scholarship. Itâ€™s a launchpad.

### Helping You Take Off

We started this fund because weâ€™ve seen firsthand how a single opportunity can change a life. Whether itâ€™s a student who grew up watching planes from their backyard or a teen determined to be the first pilot in their family, the spark is always there. Our job â€” and our privilege â€” is to fuel it.

This program covers the full cost of training from your first lesson to your checkride. It includes materials, instruction, aircraft rental, mentorship, and testing fees. We donâ€™t just want you to learn to fly â€” we want you to thrive.

## **Whoâ€™s Eligible?**

To apply, you must:

- Be a high school junior or senior
- Be at least 16 years old by the time you solo, and no older than 19 by the time you complete training
- Plan to pursue a degree in aviation after graduation
- Pass a DOT-compliant drug screening before training begins
- Obtain an FAA First Class Medical Certificate before Phase Two
- Commit to staying drug- and alcohol-free
- Hold a clean driving record and agree to follow all traffic laws
- Be responsible for your own transportation to and from **Atlanta Speedway Airport (KHMP)**

You donâ€™t need flight experience. You donâ€™t need money. What you need is commitment, discipline, and the drive to succeed.

## **The Three Phases of the Scholarship Program**

### **Phase One: Ground School & Written Exam**

This first phase focuses on academic preparation. Students receive FAA-approved study materials, one-on-one instructor guidance, and test fee coverage. Youâ€™ll have up to three attempts to pass the FAA Private Pilot Knowledge Test with a minimum score of **80%**.

Once you pass the test, you're cleared to fly.

### **Phase Two: First Solo Flight**

After passing your written exam and completing your medical, you'll begin flight training at our home base in Hampton, Georgia. The goal of this phase is your first solo flight â€” a defining moment in any pilot's journey.

All flight time, instructor fees, and aircraft rental are fully funded. Most students will solo within **15 flight hours**.

### **Phase Three: Certification as a Private Pilot**

This final stage is where everything comes together. Youâ€™ll continue flight training to meet FAA minimums, sharpen your skills, and prepare for the checkride. The scholarship includes:

- Up to **50 hours** of flight time (with up to 10 more hours available in special cases)
- Instructor and aircraft fees
- All checkride and testing costs

Youâ€™ll graduate with your FAA Private Pilot Certificate â€” the first big step toward an aviation career.

## **Our Commitment to the Next Generation**

We know what itâ€™s like to dream of flight. Every member of our team was once in your shoes. Thatâ€™s why this scholarship means so much to us â€” because itâ€™s our chance to give back.

Weâ€™re proud to open the skies to students who may not otherwise have the chance. Proud to invest in the future of aviation. And most of all, proud to help you become the pilot youâ€™ve always wanted to be.
