At Speedway Flight Training, we proudly operate the venerable **Cessna C172** as our primary training aircraft—an industry standard renowned for its reliability, performance, and safety. For decades, the Cessna C172 has been the backbone of pilot training programs worldwide, and for good reason. Its forgiving flight characteristics, stable handling, and dependable systems make it the perfect platform for student pilots and experienced aviators alike. Whether you're practicing your first takeoff or refining cross-country navigation skills, the C172 provides unmatched consistency and ease of operation.

## A Fleet You Can Count On

We take great pride in the quality and care of our fleet. Each Cessna C172 in our lineup features a meticulously maintained leather interior and sports our distinctive **Speedway Flight Training Red, White, and Blue** paint scheme. This iconic design not only sets our aircraft apart visually but also symbolizes the commitment to excellence and patriotism at the heart of our training philosophy. Our fleet is consistently updated and serviced beyond FAA requirements, reflecting our commitment to safety and professionalism.

Our dedicated maintenance technicians ensure each aircraft is in peak condition and ready for every flight. With rigorous maintenance schedules and thorough pre-flight checks, our dispatch reliability is exceptional. Thanks to our standardized fleet and high maintenance standards, training cancellations due to mechanical issues are exceedingly rare. In fact, many of our students tell us our aircraft are the best-maintained among regional flight schools—and we’re proud to agree. Our attention to detail not only boosts reliability but also enhances your learning experience, allowing you to focus entirely on your training without concerns about aircraft readiness.

## Advanced Garmin Avionics: Fly with Confidence

All of our Cessna C172 aircraft are equipped with a modern suite of **Garmin avionics**, ensuring that you are training with the most advanced and reliable navigation systems available. This avionics package includes:

- **Dual Garmin G5 Electronic Flight Instruments**: One serves as the **Primary Flight Display (PFD)**, delivering crucial flight information like airspeed, altitude, and attitude. The other functions as the **Navigation Display (ND)**, offering situational awareness during every phase of flight. The dual-display setup mirrors the instrumentation found in modern commercial aircraft, preparing you for seamless transitions as you advance in your flight career.

- **Garmin GTN650xi Navigator**: The most advanced Garmin navigator available, featuring satellite-based navigation, VHF communication, and integrated **ADS-B traffic awareness**. This unit allows for precise waypoint navigation, instrument approaches, and seamless communication with ATC. Its touchscreen interface simplifies data entry, making flight planning and in-flight adjustments smoother and faster.

- **Garmin GTX345 Transponder**: This transponder provides **ADS-B In and Out**, sending real-time traffic and weather information to the GTN650xi and directly to your iPad or tablet. With **TIS (Traffic Information Service)** and **FIS-B (Flight Information Service - Broadcast)** capabilities, you stay informed of airborne traffic and weather hazards, enhancing your situational awareness. This technology is crucial for modern airspace operations and adds a layer of safety to every training flight.

## Technically Advanced Aircraft (TAA) for Modern Pilot Training

Several of our C172s are designated as **Technically Advanced Aircraft (TAA)**, featuring the **Garmin GFC500 Autopilot with electric trim**. This state-of-the-art autopilot system brings enhanced stability and precision to your flight training. For students pursuing their **Commercial Pilot License (CPL)**, mastering TAA operations is a requirement—and Speedway Flight Training ensures you are prepared with the best equipment available. The GFC500’s advanced features include altitude hold, vertical speed adjustments, and GPS flight path tracking, mirroring the automation skills required for larger, more complex aircraft.

Not only does learning in a TAA prepare you for advanced certifications, but it also gives you a competitive edge when transitioning to more complex aircraft. You will develop a deeper understanding of automated flight controls, improving both your precision and your decision-making skills in dynamic environments. Our commitment to providing TAA-certified aircraft ensures you are always ahead of the curve when it comes to modern aviation technology.
