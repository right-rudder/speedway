## Understanding the FAA Medical Certificate
Before you can solo or earn your Private Pilot License, you’ll need an **FAA medical certificate**. This document confirms that you meet the health standards to safely operate an aircraft, a key step that every aspiring pilot must complete.

At **Speedway Flight Training**, we help our students navigate the process so that medical certification never becomes an obstacle on their journey to the cockpit.

## 1. The Three Classes of FAA Medical Certificates
### Class 1 - Airline Transport Pilots
For professional airline pilots, a **Class 1 Medical** is required. It includes the most comprehensive health screening, covering vision, hearing, cardiovascular health, and more.

### Class 2 - Commercial Pilots
For those pursuing paid flying work such as aerial photography, charter, or instruction, a **Class 2 Medical** is sufficient.

### Class 3 - Student & Private Pilots
Most students at Speedway start here. A **Class 3 Medical** ensures you’re fit to act as pilot in command of general aviation aircraft for personal or training use.

## 2. What to Expect During Your Exam
Your **Aviation Medical Examiner (AME)** will conduct:
- Vision and hearing tests.
- Blood pressure and heart rate checks.
- Urinalysis (for sugar and protein levels).
- Basic neurological and mental health evaluation.

> **Tip:** Bring your ID, glasses (if applicable), and any relevant prescriptions or medical records.

## 3. How to Prepare and Schedule
1. Visit [medxpress.faa.gov](https://medxpress.faa.gov) to fill out your FAA application.  
2. Locate an **AME near you** using the FAA’s online directory.  
3. Schedule your appointment (many AMEs near Atlanta and McDonough have availability within a week).  

If you’re unsure which medical class to pursue, our Speedway instructors can advise based on your long-term goals.

## 4. Common Concerns and Misconceptions
### “What if I have vision issues?”
Glasses or contacts are perfectly acceptable, as long as your vision can be corrected to 20/20.

### “I take prescription medication, will I be disqualified?”
Not necessarily. Some medications require review, but many pilots fly safely with approved prescriptions.

### “Can I start flight training before my medical?”
Yes. You can begin ground school and dual instruction, but a valid medical is required before your **first solo flight**.
