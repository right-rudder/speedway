If you’ve earned your Private Pilot License and you’re ready to unlock more flying days, more capability, and more confidence, the Instrument Rating (IR) is your next big step. At **Speedway Flight Training** in Hampton, GA, we’ve designed an instrument program that turns “marginal VFR” days into smart, safe missions—without wasting your time or your budget.

## Why earn your Instrument Rating?

- **Fly more often, more safely**. Weather is the #1 limiter for VFR pilots. IR training teaches you to plan, brief, and fly precise procedures so you can handle low ceilings, visibility, and busy airspace with confidence.

- **Build real-world decision-making**. You’ll master instrument cross-countries, holds, approaches, missed approaches, and automation management—skills that translate directly to safer, smoother flights.

- **Open doors for your career**. If you’re eyeing the commercial track, IR is mandatory—and a powerful differentiator when you start logging time toward advanced ratings.

## Why Speedway for IFR?

- **The location is ideal**. We’re based at Atlanta Speedway Airport (KHMP)—a non-towered field with minimal traffic—so you spend more time flying and less time waiting. You’ll still train near Atlanta’s Class B for authentic ATC experience.

- **The schedule fits your life**. Flight training is available daily from 6:00 AM to 11:30 PM, with business hours of 9:00 AM–4:00 PM for the front desk—perfect if you’re balancing work, school, or family.

- **The fleet is IFR-ready**. You’ll train in IFR-equipped Cessna 172s, including TAA aircraft with Garmin G5 and GFC 500—a modern glass + autopilot combo that helps you learn solid scan habits and smart automation use from day one.

- **A clear, structured plan**. We operate a professional, Part 61 program (with Part 141 approval in progress) and a “Fast Track” pathway if you want to stack ratings efficiently with mentorship and structure.

## What your 6–8 week IR at Speedway looks like

### Phase 1: Foundations & Procedures

- IFR regulations, weather services, instrument scan, radio work

- Basic attitude instrument flying, unusual attitude recovery

- Holds, entries, and intercepts

### Phase 2: Approaches & Workload Management

- ILS, LOC, LPV/GPS, and VOR approaches

- Missed approach procedures and circling minima

- Automation: using the G5 + GFC 500 to reduce workload (without over-reliance)

### Phase 3: Cross-Country & Checkride Prep

- IFR cross-country planning and execution

- Risk management & alternate planning

- Mock oral + full profile checkride rehearsal

**Timeline & Cost:** Many students complete the rating in **6–8 weeks**. The program’s estimated cost is about **$13,000** (based on 40 hours of flight training; actual totals vary with proficiency and study habits).

_Pro tip: The fastest-moving students front-load their studying, chair-fly procedures, and show up with a solid briefing plan. Your instructor will give you a checklist-driven workflow that you can repeat on every flight._

## What makes training at KHMP efficient (and fun)

- **Less congestion, more reps.** Non-towered ops mean you’ll typically squeeze in more approaches and holds per lesson—key to building muscle memory faster.

- **Real-world radio.** You’ll work with Atlanta’s airspace without the constant delays of a major commercial field. That balance is perfect for instrument students.

- **Local landmarks & routes.** You’ll brief and fly procedures you’ll actually use after you pass—so your first post-checkride IFR trip feels familiar, not foreign.

## How to prepare before Day 1

- Lock the knowledge early. Knock out your instrument knowledge test prep and start a daily weather + NOTAM review habit.

- Bring the right tools. An iPad (cellular-capable, 6th gen or newer), headset, logbook, and your selected EFB keep training smooth. (Your instructor will review your exact kit.)

- Plan your schedule. With early-morning and late-evening training blocks available, you can stack lessons when the weather cooperates.
