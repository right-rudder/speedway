        Speedway Flight Training (Speedway) was established at Atlanta Speedway Airport with a vision to provide high-quality flight training in the competitive Los Angeles area. What started as a passion project quickly evolved into a leading flight school with over 1,000 graduates and a 100% checkride pass rate.<br>

        Our commitment to excellence is reflected in our carefully curated team of experienced Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs), who have a combined 13,000+ flight hours and bring a wealth of real-world aviation expertise. Many of our instructors are trained in-house, ensuring a cohesive, family-like atmosphere that supports student success.<br>

We also specialize in accelerated multi-engine training, attracting students nationwide with an average completion time of 1.5 weeks.<br>

        Our modern fleet features IFR-capable aircraft equipped with Garmin Dual G5s and advanced avionics, providing students with hands-on experience using the latest technology.
